"""Serialization helpers for converting simulation data to xarray/Zarr format.

This module handles conversion of nested dictionaries (typically containing
simulation "memories" like spike trains, voltages, and synaptic states) into
xarray Datasets for storage and analysis.

Sparse Encoding Semantics
-------------------------
Arrays are encoded in sparse COO format when beneficial. For a variable
named ``spikes`` with shape ``(T, B, N)`` and ``nnz`` non-zero entries:

- ``spikes``: scalar marker with attrs ``{"_btorch_sparse": True, ...}``
- ``spikes_idx_time``: indices along time dim, shape ``(nnz,)``
- ``spikes_idx_batch``: indices along batch dim, shape ``(nnz,)``
- ``spikes_idx_neuron``: indices along neuron dim, shape ``(nnz,)``
- ``spikes_data``: actual values, shape ``(nnz,)``

The sparse dimension is named ``_btorch_sparse_idx_{var_name}`` to avoid
collisions. Original dtype and shape are preserved in the marker attrs.

Shape Conventions
-----------------
Dimension groups are specified via ``dim_names`` (default:
``("time", "batch", "neuron")``) and ``dim_counts`` (how many physical
dimensions each logical group spans). For example:

- ``dim_counts=(1, 1, 2)`` with ``dim_names=("time", "batch", "neuron")``
  produces physical dims ``["time", "batch", "neuron_0", "neuron_1"]``
- A tensor of shape ``(100, 32, 64, 64)`` would map as
  ``(time=100, batch=32, neuron_0=64, neuron_1=64)``

Partial recordings (only a subset of neurons recorded) are expanded to full
size by filling missing entries with NaN (float) or 0 (integer/bool).
